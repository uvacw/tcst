# The Communication Scientist's Toolbox

The Communication Scientist's Toolbox is a collection of scripts that might help you to analyze and collect data. Our aim is to provide students and researchers with the tools they need to conduct Communication Science methods like content analysis or network analysis in a digital environment.

The toolbox is work in progress, and you are more than welcome to contribute. I hope to hear from you!

##  What do I need?

[Python](www.python.org). The scripts are written in Python 2.7. Some scripts will run with older versions, but they are not compatible with Python 3. Some scripts need additional Packages like [numpy](www.numpy.org), [scipy](www.scipy.org), [NLTK](www.nltk.org) or [Pattern](www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern).


## How can I learn all this?

First of all, if you are a student, you can enroll in my Research Master Course on Big Data and automated content anylsis at the Graduate School of Communication at the University of Amsterdam. You can also have a look at my tutorial [Python for Communication Scientists](www.damiantrilling.net/downloads/py_for_cs.pdf).

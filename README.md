The Communication Scientist's Toolbox

The Communication Scientist's Toolbox is a collection of scripts that might help you to analyze and collect data. Our aim is to provide students and researchers with the tools they need to conduct Communication Science methods like content analysis or network analysis in a digital environment.

The toolbox is work in progress, and you are more than welcome to contribute.
